/title: Why I'm still not on Facebook (VK, whatever)

* The personal page on Facebook makes you feel you are no different
  from other N billion people: the consistent look, the similar info
  on every page.
* Facebook personal page encourages you to show off, share your
  personal data publicly as much as possible. I don't feel like I have
  a need for this.
* Facebook encourages you to visit their website often. So they can
  make more money from ads. I don't like it, I would prefer to have
  ability to read everything with a feed reader with no ads instead.
* Facebook is used by many for messaging. There are many other
  services for chatting. Though I would prefer not to bind myself to a
  single service provider. The old plain email is still good for many
  cases.
* Facebook is very centralized. All the info about everyone might be
  (in case of vk.com it definitely is) accessible by the local
  intelligence organizations. You might think it's not a big deal for
  you. Though you might be wrong. Watch this video:

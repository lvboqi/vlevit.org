/title: Why I'm not using Facebook, VKontakte, etc.

* The personal page on Facebook makes you feel you are no different
  from other N billion people: the consistent look, the similar info
  on everybody's page.
* Facebook personal page encourages you to show off, share your
  personal data publicly as much as possible. I don't feel like I have
  a need for this.
* Facebook owns your personal data and takes decisions on how to use
  your data on its own.
* Facebook encourages you to visit their website often. So they can
  make more money from ads. I don't like it, I would prefer to have
  ability to read everything with a feed reader with no ads instead.
* Facebook is used by many for messaging. I would prefer not put all
  my personal communication under control of single company. There are
  many other decentralized chat services and the old plain email is
  still good for many use cases.
* Facebook is very centralized. All the information about everyone has
  been accessible by state intelligence organizations. You might think
  it's not a big deal for you. Though you might be wrong. Watch this

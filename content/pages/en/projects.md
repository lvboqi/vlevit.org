### Python
* **[xatk]** is a window switcher for X11 which activates windows by
  keybindings. There are a few blog posts about xatk in Russian (by me
  and few others): [1], [2], [3], [4] and blog post on [xatk 0.2] in
  English. Also there is a documentation on [Read the Docs].

### Bash

* **[notify-send.sh]** is a compatible notify-send replacement with
  ability to change and close existing notifications.

* **[FLAC-Convert]** is a script which converts FLAC audio to lossy formats
  incrementally utilizing several CPU cores. I'm a contributor, not the author.

* **[unisync]** is a [Unison] (file synchronizer) wrapper. It simplifies
  configuration for multiple replicas and running Unison from command line.

* **[mnuc]** is a script that sets current playing song's album cover as background
  for ncmpcpp running from urxvt.

* **[transmission-batch-move]** is a script which can "explain" Transmission that
  all (or many) files are moved somewhere. The script does the job by editing
  Transmissions' resume files.

* **[close-all-windows]** is a simple script which closes all open windows and
  optionally waits until they are closed.
